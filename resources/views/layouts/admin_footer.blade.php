        <p>What is an admin panel you may ask? It’s an admin-specific platform in an application that allows for access <br>
            and manipulation of data within the user interface of the site. The admin panel can help user-related functions, <br>
            such as providing insight into user behavior, dealing with profiles that violate the site’s terms and conditions, <br>
            and tracking transactions. But you should know that admin sites are not just limited to user-related tasks.</p>
